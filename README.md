# hello-world
Starting tutorial project

Hello everyone, I'm Eric Fisher and I'm hoping to work with Mike Stenta and Alex Smith of FarmOS to develop iOS data collection
applications. I'm new to Github, FarmOS and iOS, though I'm a 45-year veteran coder. I'm looking forward to learning the
Swift programming language and helping on this vital project.
